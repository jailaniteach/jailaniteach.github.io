## Observation Feedback and Comments

In general, the feedback I received from my supervisor and mentor regarding my lesson planning, lesson delivery, knowledge competence, classroom management, teaching aids, observation, self-reflection, and development has been mainly positive. However, there are areas for improvement that we will discuss based on these feedbacks.

The first feedback I received is that I haven't been providing model examples. Typically, I would explain the expected product without showing the finished product to the students first during the practical sessions. I agree that showing the finished product beforehand can greatly help students' interest and provide them with a visual idea of what they are trying to achieve. From now on, whenever there is a chance, I will show the finished product to the students first.

The second feedback I received was that I haven't been stating the learning objectives of the lessons in writing. Although I briefly mention them at the beginning of the lessons, I understand the feedback that some students might miss it. If the objectives are in writing, either projected through a slide or written on the whiteboard, it would be better than just briefly mentioning them to the students.

Another feedback is regarding my bad habit of assuming that students know which part I am trying to explain. I tend to use phrases like "this one" or "that one" instead of using the actual terms of the code parts I am referring to. It is advised to avoid this and use the specific terms for better clarity.

The fourth feedback is that I lack positive reinforcement when students answer my questions correctly. I didn't notice this until it was pointed out to me. It is something I need to be mindful of since even if it is just something trivial, it could greatly improve the students' motivation.

The last feedback that I would like to discuss is the lack of videos or pictures of real-world applications that can be implemented from the concepts we learn. Referring to the first feedback, I could have used this approach if there were no model examples that could be run and shown to the students.

From these five feedbacks, it is apparent that there are still a lot of improvements that can be done to my teaching, even with my 9 years of teaching experience. These could have gone unnoticed if they were not observed by others. That means as a teacher, having my lessons observed is important if I want to improve my teaching. I must have the right mindset as well.
