## 1. PBAS Training

Prior to taking a leave to take DTE course, I was heavily involved with the development of Politeknik Brunei’s Admission System (PBAS) as one of the System Developers and Administrators. To prevent overburdening me from these tasks, I was only tasked to provide advice when needed in terms of previous implementations. There are occasions where I needs to give advice. Another task is to give training to Cikgu Atiqah Musfirah Leong binti Mohd Dennis Leong on how to extract applicants’ data from PBAS.
