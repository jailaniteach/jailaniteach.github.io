## 1. First Session

**Lesson Date:** 30/01/2023

### Lesson

I successfully implemented a lesson plan focused on the basic concepts of Git. The main learning objective of this module was for students to apply the fundamentals of Git effectively.

To achieve this objective, the lesson plan included the following activities:

During the practical session on Git, which lasted for 1 hour, I ensured that all students successfully installed Git on their computers. I then facilitated the configuration of Git globally for each student's computer, including settings such as name, email, colorized output, and preferred text editor. Next, I guided the students on how to create a repository and emphasized the importance of avoiding nested repositories. In cases where a nested repository issue occurred, I assisted the students in rectifying the problem. Throughout the session, I facilitated the students' understanding of various Git functionalities, including recording changes, checking repository status, adding notes about changes, reviewing repository history, comparing file differences, managing the staging area, identifying old file versions, reviewing changes in the repository, and recovering previous versions of files. Additionally, I provided guidance on how to instruct Git to ignore specific files that students did not want the repository to track.

Following the practical session, a 15-minute online quiz was administered via the PBLMS platform to assess students' understanding of the Git concepts covered.

To further reinforce the learning, an exercise on Git was conducted, which lasted for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Students were given exercises 01, 02, and 03 to complete, which were posted on PBLMS. If students finished early, they were instructed to continue with exercises 04 and 05.

### Reflective Evaluation
The first practical session on Git ran longer than expected and concluded at 9:12 am. To ensure better comprehension, I provided additional explanations, emphasizing the concepts of the working directory, staging area, and Git directory.

All students managed to complete the online quiz within the allocated time, demonstrating their understanding of the covered material.

During the exercise, it was noted that for Windows users, some had to type the quote key twice for it to display properly. This caused issues in Bash, as students accidentally pressed enter without closing the quote.

A few students missed a step in the exercise that required resolving nested Git repositories by removing the .git folders from the child folders.

It was observed that there was insufficient access to power outlets, limiting the availability of charging options for all students' laptops. This issue impacted some students' ability to complete the exercises effectively.

Overall, the lesson plan effectively covered the learning objective of applying the basics of Git. Reflecting on the session, I will consider implementing additional strategies to address technical issues and ensure adequate resources for all students in future sessions.

## 2.Second Session

**Lesson Date**: 31/01/2023

### Lesson

I successfully implemented a lesson plan focused on teaching students how to collaborate using GitHub. The learning objectives of this module were as follows:

Students should personally own a GitHub account.
Students should be able to host and manage Git repositories on GitHub.
Students should be able to collaborate effectively using GitHub.
To achieve these objectives, the lesson plan included the following activities:

During the lecture, which lasted for 20 minutes, I highlighted the advantages of version control when collaborating with others. I explained how Git repositories can be stored on the web and introduced popular Git hosting services such as GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab. Emphasizing that we would be using GitHub for this module, I encouraged students to create a GitHub account.

In the practical session, which lasted for 1 hour, I guided the students through various tasks on GitHub. First, I facilitated the students in registering their GitHub accounts, preferably using a student license. Then, I familiarized them with the GitHub dashboard and demonstrated how to create a new repository on GitHub. Next, I guided the students on connecting their local repositories to the remote repositories on GitHub. I showed them how to sync changes made in their local repositories to the remote repositories and vice versa. Additionally, I explained how to add collaborators to their remote repositories, download copies of their friends' repositories to their local machines, make changes to their friends' repositories locally, and sync those changes to their friends' remote repositories. I also covered conflict resolution when multiple users made changes to the same file. Furthermore, I introduced the concept of Git branching and explored the features available in GitHub.

To reinforce the learning, an exercise was conducted, lasting for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Students were given Git exercises 06, 07, and 08, which were posted on PBLMS.

### Reflective Evaluation
During the session, I discovered that students already had GitHub accounts registered during their Basic Web Programming module. This saved time that I had initially allocated for account registration. As a result, I was able to utilize the extra time to integrate the Eclipse IDE with Git and assist the students in becoming familiar with using Git through the Eclipse IDE.

It was noted that some students were using older versions of the Eclipse IDE that did not have the Git plugin installed automatically. Due to slow internet connections, some students had to make multiple attempts to successfully install the plugin.

Another issue that arose was that the Eclipse IDE Git plugin did not support HTTPS authentication. This oversight occurred because I had previously set up my computer to use SSH authentication when testing the Eclipse IDE Git plugin. Fortunately, the Eclipse IDE had a built-in RSA key generation feature that could be used for SSH authentication.

Overall, the lesson plan effectively covered the learning objectives related to collaboration with GitHub. Reflecting on the session, I will ensure to provide clearer instructions regarding the version compatibility and authentication requirements when using the Eclipse IDE with Git.
