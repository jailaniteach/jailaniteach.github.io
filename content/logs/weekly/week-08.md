## 1. First Session

**Lesson Date:** 06/03/2023

### Lesson

The objective of this lesson plan was to help students understand and implement the model component of the Spring Framework. The learning objective for this module was as follows:

Understand and able to implement the model component of the Spring Framework.
To achieve this objective, the lesson plan included the following activities:

During the lecture session, I explained the concept of the Spring Model and introduced the concept of Plain Old Java Object (POJO). I demonstrated examples of POJO and explained how to use them in the controller. Additionally, I explained how to allow Thymeleaf, the template engine, to access the objects in the controller. I showed examples of using POJO in the controller and explained how to make static pages dynamic using Thymeleaf. Furthermore, I covered how to access objects passed from the controller using Thymeleaf and demonstrated the concatenation of data in Thymeleaf syntax. To supplement the lecture, I shared a video demonstrating various things that can be done using Thymeleaf, providing further insights and practical examples.

During the practical session, I facilitated the implementation of a student management system, building upon the concepts covered in the lecture.

### Reflective Evaluation
I overestimated the length of the lecture, as it only took 1 hour instead of the planned 1 hour and 30 minutes. However, I utilized the extra 30 minutes effectively by providing more in-depth explanations and discussions with the students, particularly regarding the video on Thymeleaf and its capabilities. This allowed for a better understanding and appreciation of the potential applications of Thymeleaf in web development.

Moving forward, I will ensure to adjust the duration of the lecture accordingly to maintain an optimal pace for the students. Additionally, I will continue to provide supplemental resources, such as videos, to enhance the learning experience and provide further insights into the topics covered.

## 2. Second Session

**Lesson Date:** 07/03/2023

### Lesson

The objective of this lesson plan was to ensure that students are on the right track for Assignment 1 and to facilitate the implementation of a student management system. The learning objectives for this module were as follows:

Making sure the students are on the right track for Assignment 1.
The activities included in this lesson plan were as follows:

During the consultation session, I provided an opportunity for students to consult with me and polish up their solutions for Assignment 1. This allowed students to clarify any doubts, seek guidance, and refine their work.

During the practical session, I facilitated the implementation of a student management system, building upon the concepts covered in previous lessons and lectures.

### Reflective Evaluation
Some students encountered difficulties in collaborating using GitHub, particularly with merge conflicts. However, with proper guidance and assistance, students were able to resolve these issues and gain a better understanding of version control and collaborative development practices. Another common issue observed was the inability to pull updates from the repository. Upon investigation, it was found that students had not committed their code before attempting to pull updates.

To address these challenges, I encouraged students to come and see me even during the semester break for any issues they encounter with the assignment and GitHub. By providing ongoing support and guidance, I aim to ensure that students can overcome any obstacles they face and successfully complete their assignments.

Moving forward, I will continue to emphasize the importance of committing changes before pulling updates and provide additional resources and guidance on using version control effectively. I will also explore additional opportunities for students to practice and enhance their collaboration skills using tools like GitHub.
