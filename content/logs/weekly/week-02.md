## Lesson Date: 28/01/2023

As an educator, I successfully implemented a lesson plan on the topic of version control systems. The primary learning objectives of this module were to ensure that students: (1) were aware of the topics covered in this module, including the aims, learning objectives, and assessment components, (2) could describe the benefits of an automated version control system.
Had a basic understanding of how version control systems work, (3) became familiar with navigating file systems using Bash commands, (4) to achieve these objectives, I structured the lesson plan with the following activities:

During the first lecture, which lasted for 30 minutes, I introduced myself, provided my contact information, and emphasized that all communication should be conducted via email. I explained the purpose and content of the module, emphasizing that a solid understanding of the topics covered in the Introduction to Programming module was crucial for success. Furthermore, I outlined the aims, learning objectives, timeline, and assessment details for the module. Lastly, I provided an overview of the typical weekly class activities.

The second lecture, which lasted for 1 hour, focused on Git. I explained the motivation behind using version control systems and drew connections to familiar tools like Microsoft Word's Track Changes, Google Docs' version history, and LibreOffice's Recording and Displaying Changes. Additionally, I clarified the main purpose and functioning of version control systems and introduced different types of version control systems, including Local VCS, Centralized VCS, and Distributed VCS. I defined Git and thoroughly explained how it works, covering the Three States of Git (Working Directory, Staging Area, and Repository) and the basic Git workflow.

During the practical session on Git, which lasted for 30 minutes, I shared the necessary instructions for installing Git and provided guidance to ensure every student successfully installed the software.

In the final practical session, which lasted for 1 hour, students were instructed to open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Linux or Mac). I explained the purpose and significance of this software and guided students through various tasks, including navigating folders, listing folder contents, creating and copying folders and files, moving folders and files, displaying the current working directory, and deleting folders and files (with a warning about the immediate deletion).

Reflective Evaluation:
It became evident during the practical session on Git that some students had difficulty grasping the concept due to limited understanding of how file systems work. Therefore, in the upcoming week, I plan to place greater emphasis on explaining how Git works during the practical session. This additional focus will help students visualize the connection between version control and file systems.

Overall, I believe the lesson plan effectively covered the learning objectives for this module. The combination of lectures and practical exercises allowed students to gain an understanding of version control systems and develop practical skills in using Git and Bash commands for file system navigation.
