## 1. First Session

**Lesson Date:** 08/05/2023

### Lesson

The learning objective of this lesson plan was to ensure that students were on the right track with their Assignment 2. The objective for this session was as follows:

Ensure students are progressing effectively with their Assignment 2.
The main activity included in this lesson plan was a group consultation session, which lasted for 3 hours.

During the group consultation session, students were given dedicated time to consult with me and refine their solutions for Assignment 2. The purpose of this session was to guide students in finalizing their work and assist with any issues they were encountering in their implementations. I provided personalized support, answered questions, and offered suggestions for improvement based on their individual progress.

### Reflective Evaluation
Throughout the consultation session, I focused on helping students align their solutions with the assignment requirements and providing guidance on how to refine their implementations. I addressed any issues they were facing and offered suggestions for improvement, aiming to ensure that their solutions were on the right track.

It was observed that some students encountered difficulties with GitHub and its integration with the Spring Tool Suite (STS). To bypass these issues, some students opted to directly interact with the GitHub website instead of relying on the STS interface. While this workaround allowed them to continue working on their assignments, it highlighted the importance of troubleshooting and finding alternative solutions when faced with technical challenges.

In future sessions, it would be beneficial to allocate time for a brief refresher on using GitHub with STS, emphasizing best practices and troubleshooting common issues. This would help students navigate any problems more effectively and promote a smoother workflow throughout the assignment.

Overall, the group consultation session was productive, with students actively seeking guidance and refining their Assignment 2 solutions. By addressing their concerns and offering support, I ensured that students were making progress and were better equipped to complete their assignments successfully. Encouraging resourcefulness and problem-solving skills when faced with technical challenges allowed students to continue their work effectively.

## 2. Second Session

**Lesson Date:** 09/05/2023

### Lesson

The learning objectives of this lesson plan were as follows:

Enable students to understand the expectations for the upcoming examinations.
Provide a recap of the topics covered in the course.
The activities included in this lesson plan were as follows:

Lecture (45 minutes):
During this session, I conducted a lecture to familiarize students with the examination format and what they should expect. I explained the structure of the examination, including both theory and practical components. Additionally, I highlighted the specific topics that students should revise in preparation for the examination. To enhance their understanding, I presented them with example theory and practical questions. To supplement the lecture, we also watched a video how to prepare for examination: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9SptdjpJBQ

Exercise (1 hour 15 minutes):
Following the lecture, I assigned specific questions to individual students, allowing them to attempt past year papers. By allocating students to answer specific questions, I aimed to ensure that each student engaged with the material and had the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding. This exercise served as a practical application of their knowledge, enabling them to practice and refine their skills in a timed setting.

Discussion (1 hour):
In the final hour of the session, we engaged in a group discussion to review and discuss the students' answers to the assigned questions. This allowed students to compare their approaches, identify areas of improvement, and clarify any doubts they had. Through this interactive discussion, I facilitated peer learning and provided additional explanations and insights where necessary.

### Reflective Evaluation
One observation from the exercise and discussion sessions was that some students took time to recall and apply the concepts they had learned. However, I am pleased to note that overall, students actively collaborated and worked together to solve the past year paper questions. This cooperative learning environment fostered critical thinking and problem-solving skills among the students.

I am pleased to report that the majority of the students managed to answer their respective questions correctly. However, there were instances where students made minor errors or mistakes due to oversight or lack of attention. These mistakes served as valuable learning opportunities, emphasizing the importance of careful reading and attention to detail during examinations.

The exercise and discussion sessions provided an effective platform for students to consolidate their knowledge, clarify doubts, and gain confidence in their understanding of the topics. By actively engaging with the past year papers and discussing their answers, students were able to identify areas where they needed further review or practice. This process not only reinforced their knowledge but also helped them develop effective examination strategies.

Overall, the lesson plan successfully achieved its objectives of familiarizing students with the examination format, revising key topics, and providing practice opportunities. As an educator, I will continue to encourage students to review and practice independently to further strengthen their understanding and readiness for the upcoming examinations.
