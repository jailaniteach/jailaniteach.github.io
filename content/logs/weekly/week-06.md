## 1. First Session

**Lesson Date:** 20/02/2023

### Lesson

The objective of this lesson plan was to enable students to implement a basic client-server application. The learning objective for this module was as follows:

Able to implement a basic Client-Server Application.
To achieve this objective, the lesson plan included the following activities:

During the 1-hour 30-minute practical session, I facilitated the implementation of a server-client number guessing game. First, I guided students in implementing the basic requirements, which included the server generating a random number from 1 to 100 and the client needing to guess the number until they answered correctly. The server would provide feedback to the client, indicating if the guess was higher or lower than the generated number. Both the client and server applications would terminate after the client guessed correctly. Additionally, I facilitated the implementation of the advanced requirements, where the server would match two clients into a session on a first-come, first-serve basis and generate a random number for each session. Both clients in the session would then guess the generated number, and the server would inform each client if their guess was higher or lower. The server would terminate the session after a client guessed correctly and announce the winner.

During the 1-hour 30-minute exercise session, I facilitated the implementation of a server-client playing the cangkul card game. The rules of the game were provided to the students, and they were tasked with implementing the game based on those rules.

### Reflective Evaluation
During the practical session, I underestimated the time required to implement the guessing game, especially when including the advanced features. It took approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete the implementation, exceeding the allotted time. As a result, most students were unable to finish the advanced requirements within the given time frame. In the last 30 minutes, I allocated time for students to read through the rules of the cangkul card game, which would be the focus of the next session.

One of the contributing factors to the extended time needed during the practical session was the misconception among students regarding how to handle two clients in one server and how to manage multiple sessions with two clients. However, the students thoroughly enjoyed seeing the results of their implementations and were eager to try it out themselves.

Considering the time constraints and the need to cover the exercise implementation, I made the decision to have the students work on the exercise during the next session. This would allow them more time to understand and implement the rules of the cangkul card game.

In the future, I will allocate more time for practical sessions, taking into account potential challenges and misconceptions that students may face. By providing sufficient time and addressing any misconceptions promptly, I aim to ensure that students have a better understanding of the concepts and are able to complete the implementation within the designated time frame.

## 2. Second Session

**Lesson Date:** 21/02/2023

### Lesson

The objective of this lesson plan was to enable students to implement a basic client-server application. The learning objective for this module was as follows:

Able to implement a basic Client-Server Application.
To achieve this objective, the lesson plan included the following activities:

During the 1-hour lecture, I conducted a briefing regarding Assignment 1, emphasizing the deadline and explaining the scenario. I provided instructions on how to register into groups, distributed tasks among the group members, and explained the grading criteria and rules for the assignment.

During the 1-hour 30-minute practical session, I facilitated the implementation of a server-client chat application. The requirements included the server handling three clients, where a client would send a message to the server, and the server would forward the message to the other two clients. The goal was to ensure that messages were received concurrently, even if a client had not yet typed anything.

During the 30-minute exercise session, I facilitated the implementation of a server-client playing the cangkul card game. The rules of the game were provided to the students, and they were tasked with implementing the game based on those rules.

### Reflective Evaluation
Some students felt pressured when reviewing the assignment brief as they tended to overthink the features they needed to implement. To address this, I emphasized that they could focus on a small part of the theme and break it down into manageable features. This helped alleviate some of the pressure and allowed them to approach the assignment more confidently.

During the practical session, I encountered an issue where some students complained that their application was not working. Upon investigation, I discovered that these students were only running two clients instead of the required three clients. I intervened and emphasized to the entire class that running all three clients was crucial for the application to function properly. I demonstrated the misconception to the students and reiterated the importance of following the instructions accurately.

In hindsight, I realized that I had forgotten to inform the students about their quizzes that were scheduled for the same week. To address this oversight, I allowed the students to complete the quizzes during the session and informed them that they could attempt the exercise on their own time. I assured them that I would provide the exercise details at a later date.

In future instances, I will make a note to ensure that all necessary information, such as quiz schedules, is communicated to the students in a timely manner. This will help avoid any confusion and ensure that students can effectively manage their workload and allocate sufficient time to complete all required tasks.
