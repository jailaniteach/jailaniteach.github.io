## 1. First Session

Lesson Date: 17/04/2023

The objective of this lesson plan was to apply the Java Persistence API (JPA) and ensure that students were on track with Assignment 2. The learning objectives for this module were as follows:

Apply Java Persistence API (JPA) for data persistence.
Ensure students are on the right track for Assignment 2.
The activities included in this lesson plan consisted of a practical session, an exercise, and group consultations, with a total duration of 2 hours.

During the practical session, which lasted for 30 minutes, I covered the topics of removing and updating data from the database using JPA. I demonstrated the necessary steps and provided examples to help students understand how to perform these operations effectively.

Following the practical session, a 30-minute exercise was given to the students, requiring them to complete the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation for the Group class. This exercise aimed to reinforce their understanding of JPA and its usage for data manipulation.

To ensure that students were progressing well with their assignments, a 1-hour group consultation session was conducted. During this time, students were given the opportunity to seek assistance and polish their solutions for Assignment 2. This consultation session aimed to provide personalized guidance and support to students, addressing any challenges or questions they had regarding the assignment.

Reflective Evaluation:
During the session, it was evident that some students had missed the previous class, which resulted in them facing difficulties in keeping up with the topics covered. To address this issue, I provided additional resources and guidance to help them catch up. However, considering the time constraints and the upcoming deadline for their IT project proposals, I decided to ask for approval from the program leader to extend the Assignment 2 deadline to 8th May 2023. I am pleased to mention that the extension was approved on the same day, providing students with more time to complete their assignments effectively.

To enhance future sessions, it is crucial to encourage students to attend all classes consistently, as missing sessions can hinder their progress and understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, ensuring that students have a solid foundation in the previous topics covered can prevent any gaps in their knowledge and facilitate smoother transitions between lessons.

Overall, the session was productive, and students were able to grasp the concepts of deleting and updating data using JPA. The group consultation session provided valuable support to students, enabling them to refine their Assignment 2 solutions. By extending the assignment deadline, students now have ample time to complete their tasks and meet the desired requirements.

## 2. Second Session

Lesson Date: 18/04/2023

The objective of this lesson plan was to ensure that students were on the right track with their Assignment 2. The learning objective for this session was as follows:

Ensure students are progressing effectively with their Assignment 2.
The activity included in this lesson plan was a group consultation session, which lasted for 2 hours.

During the group consultation session, students were given the opportunity to consult with me and polish up their solutions for Assignment 2. The purpose of this session was to provide guidance, answer questions, and address any concerns or challenges students were facing in relation to the assignment. It aimed to ensure that students were moving in the right direction and had a clear understanding of the requirements and expectations.

Reflective Evaluation:
The majority of the groups demonstrated a good understanding of what they wanted to implement for their Assignment 2. During the consultation session, my role mainly involved guiding them on how to proceed with their plans, providing suggestions for improvement, and clarifying any doubts they had.

However, some groups encountered unexpected issues during the session. GitHub unexpectedly added a README file into their repository, which caused problems for other students trying to collaborate on the code. This issue disrupted the collaborative workflow and required troubleshooting and resolution. To address this, I provided assistance and guidance on how to remove the unwanted README file and restore the normal functioning of the repository.

In future sessions, it is important to remind students about the potential challenges they may encounter when using collaborative platforms such as GitHub and emphasize the importance of regular backups and version control practices. Additionally, it may be beneficial to allocate some time in advance to ensure that students are familiar with the platform and its features to minimize such disruptions.

Overall, the group consultation session was productive, and students were actively engaged in refining their Assignment 2 solutions. It provided an opportunity for personalized support and guidance, ensuring that students were on track with their assignments. Addressing unexpected issues as they arose helped to create a more conducive learning environment and facilitated the smooth progress of the session.
