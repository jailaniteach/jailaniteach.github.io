## First Session

Lesson Date: 01/05/2023

The learning objective of this lesson plan was to ensure that students were on the right track with their Assignment 2. The objective for this session was as follows:

Ensure students are progressing effectively with their Assignment 2.
The main activity included in this lesson plan was a group consultation session, which lasted for 3 hours.

During the group consultation session, students were given dedicated time to consult with me and refine their solutions for Assignment 2. The purpose of this session was to guide students in finalizing their work and assist with any issues they were encountering in their implementations. I provided personalized support, answered questions, and offered suggestions for improvement based on their individual progress.

Reflective Evaluation:
One notable challenge faced by several groups during the consultation session was related to contributing to their GitHub repositories. Students were experiencing difficulties with collaboration and encountering issues that hindered their progress. As a result, a significant portion of the session was dedicated to troubleshooting and resolving these problems.

I allocated time and effort to address these GitHub-related issues and provided step-by-step guidance to students, helping them understand and overcome the obstacles they faced. I assisted with resolving conflicts, setting up proper permissions and access controls, and ensuring that everyone could effectively contribute to their group repositories.

While resolving these issues consumed a significant amount of time during the session, I am pleased to report that the majority of the problems were successfully resolved. By the end of the consultation session, students were able to resume their work on Assignment 2 with improved collaboration capabilities.

The session reinforced the importance of effective version control and collaborative practices, highlighting the challenges that can arise when using complex tools like GitHub in a group setting. By addressing these challenges head-on and providing hands-on support, I aimed to empower students to navigate and overcome similar obstacles in the future, ultimately enhancing their ability to work collaboratively on software development projects.

Overall, despite the time taken to address the GitHub issues, the consultation session was valuable in ensuring that students remained on track with their Assignment 2. By resolving the problems faced by the groups, I facilitated a smoother workflow and fostered a more productive learning environment.

## Second Session

Lesson Date: 02/05/2023

The learning objective of this lesson plan was to ensure that students were on the right track with their Assignment 2. The objective for this session was as follows:

Ensure students are progressing effectively with their Assignment 2.
The main activity included in this lesson plan was a group consultation session, which lasted for 3 hours.

During the group consultation session, students were given dedicated time to consult with me and refine their solutions for Assignment 2. The purpose of this session was to guide students in finalizing their work and assist with any issues they were encountering in their implementations. I provided personalized support, answered questions, and offered suggestions for improvement based on their individual progress.

Reflective Evaluation:
Throughout the consultation session, I focused on helping students align their solutions with the assignment requirements and providing guidance on how to refine their implementations. Many groups expressed a desire to implement validations for their CRUD operations. To assist them, I hinted at concepts they had learned in the Introduction to Programming and Object-Oriented Programming modules. I emphasized that they could leverage their knowledge of conditionals and data validation techniques to incorporate the desired validations into their solutions. Additionally, I informed them that the Spring Framework offers built-in validation tools, but utilizing these tools was not a requirement for the current module.

By encouraging students to apply their foundational programming knowledge and providing guidance on where to look for relevant concepts, I aimed to foster their problem-solving skills and empower them to take ownership of their assignments. While the module did not mandate the use of Spring's validation tools, I highlighted their availability as an optional resource for those interested in exploring advanced validation techniques.

Overall, the group consultation session was productive, with students actively seeking guidance and refining their Assignment 2 solutions. By addressing their concerns and providing hints to reinforce their programming skills, I ensured that students were making progress and were better equipped to complete their assignments successfully. Encouraging them to leverage their existing knowledge while introducing optional resources expanded their understanding and promoted a deeper exploration of validation techniques in their implementations.
