**Weekly reflections from February 2023 as per requested**

---

## Teaching Practice Week 04

**Date:** 06/02/2023 - 12/02/2023

It was a good idea to recap some of the Basic Networking concepts that are relevant with this module since some students forget some of the concepts. In terms of Java programming, I noticed some students still does not understand the basics. I need to figure out how to incorporate these to the lesson to help students remembers.

In terms of administrative work, I had to give consultations in regards to Politeknik Brunei's Admission System (PBAS).

## Teaching Practice Week 05

**Date:** 13/02/2023 - 19/02/2023

I was observed by TVET supervisor this week. The comments received are constructive. Will integrate them to my future lesson.

Tried to incorporate basic knowledge of Java programming on top of the topics that I need to cover. Had to spent more time on the practical session because of this.

## Teaching Practice Week 06

**Date:** 20/02/2023 - 26/02/2023

Underestimated my practical session where based on the preparation made it was planned to be done for 1 hour and 30 minutes. I had to spent an extra 1 hour due to misconceptions arises on the example code used for the practical session. Luckily it is still within the 3 hour class slot. Had to asked student to complete the next activity (independent exercise) within their own time.

I was involved with PB's open day this week. Had to entertained potential applicants by explaining about Application Development and Web Technologies programmes. Since these are new programmes, I had to review back what these programmes are about to make sure I accurately explain them.

More consultation for PBAS again for this week.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 07

**Date:** 27/02/2023 - 05/03/2023

Encountered a major issue during my practical session where the code that works when I was preparing them both in my Windows and Macbook computers, it did not work to half of the students' computer. Had to try multiple solutions and spent extra time outside of class on few of the students' computer just to make sure the solution are consistent for everyone.

Found out that for those that does not manage to get the code working, to downgrade the Spring Framework version. With this, all students managed to get the code working.

I am not sure why half of the students unable to use the latest version of Spring Framework. Even after diagnosing different students' computer, the potential causes are not consistent.

Another issue is due to Spring Tools Suite (the integrated development environment provided by Spring Framework) exclude the src/main/resources folder from the built path.

It was a challenging week, but since all the students managed to get their computer working, next week should be better.

## Teaching Practice Week 08

**Date:** 06/03/2023 - 12/03/2023

Had an extra 30 minutes during the class, to utilise this I provided in-depth explanations and discussions in regards to Thymeleaf. As a lecturer, I have to always prepare myself to utilise some extra time if there lesson plan went fater than expected.

I enforced students to use GitHub for their assignment submission. Students were not very familiar with this technology except for the two weeks session at the beginning of the semester. The reason I enforced this was due to using this technology is the topic for my TVET Action Research. 

Had allocate more time to help students resolve issues in regards to GitHub.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 09

**Date:** 13/03/2023 - 19/03/2023

Had assignment consultations with the students online through Microsoft Teams. It was a good initiative from the students to be proactive in doing their assignment even though this week is semester break.

<br>

---

## Teaching Practice Week 10

**Date:** 20/03/2023 - 26/03/2023

The concept of Model View Controller (MVC) is still foreign to the students even though it was covered before the semester break. With MVC, the way you write the code is very different from what they have learned so far. I had to visualise how it works accordingly through diagram to help them understand the concept. But once they see the result of the practical code, it is gratifying seeing their reaction when they get it working.

I am marking the students first assignment during this week. Noticed that a few did not fully made their feature using the network programming concept.

School of Information and Communication Technologies (SICT) is having tahlil event for this week. I attended the event and during the event, I also socialised with SICT staffs.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 11

**Date:** 27/03/2023 - 02/04/2023

Did not managed to discuss the exercise solution during one of the session. Decided to use the online route and share the solution to the students through GitHub.

Decided to incorporate the relevant concept of database in the practical session to explain about Database instead of relying the lecture notes. The lecture notes the students can use as supplimentary materials for them to understand in-depth in regards to theory of Database. I believe that as long as the students understand the basic concept, it should be sufficient for this module. But if they are interested to learn more, they can refer to the lecture notes further.

I am marking the students first assignment as well during this week. It is gratifying seeing some students solutions went beyong what I expected their solutions to be.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 12

**Date:** 03/04/2023 - 09/04/2023

The problem of using Maven as a dependency management system is that when there is an internet issue during downloading the dependencies the code will not work. So had to guide the students how to resolve this issues. The downside of this is that the students had to redownload the dependencies again from the beginning. I should have prepared an offline version containing all the dependencies so that students could just copy the file offline instead of downloading them again.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 13

**Date:** 10/04/2023 - 16/04/2023

The issue with some students does not understand the basics are still arises even though I tried to explain them again and again. I need to find online videos that could explain these basic concepts and share them to the students so that it does not affect my classroom time.

Just realised that during the exercise code will caused some issue for my practical session. It was due to me not realising the naming scheme I used in the exercise will clashed with the practical session code. So I had to spent 30 minutes to rectify this issue with the students, since I had to step by step guide the students on what files they need to edit.

I was observed again this session, but due to the nature of this week lesson, I am unable to conduct lesson according to the suggestion given during the first observation.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 14

**Date:** 17/04/2023 - 23/04/2023

I had to extend the assignment deadline to 8th May 2023. This was due to students had prioritise their IT Project proposal and struggle to concentrate to do the network programming assignment. I emphatise with the students and went to the process with the programme leader to extend the assignment deadline. The programme leader does not have any issue with me extending the assignment deadline.

Another reason why I extended as well was due to some concept is not covered completely last week and had to covered this week instead.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 15

**Date:** 24/04/2023 - 30/04/2023

Nothing to reflect for this week due to Hari Raya Aidilfitri public holiday this week.

<br>

---

## Teaching Practice Week 16

**Date:** 01/05/2023 - 07/05/2023

Same as the first assignment, I had to actively help the students with their GitHub issues. For this second assignment, GitHub somehow added a file to the students' GitHub repository during it's creation which caused major issues towards the students using GitHub. I am not sure what happened as I configured GitHub for the students the same way as the first assignment. It is quite frustrating when technologies does not cooperate with you.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 17

**Date:** 08/05/2023 - 14/05/2023

This week I conducted examination revision class with the students where I briefed them about the examination, give tips on what to do before and during examination and what topics to focus. At the same time, asked the students to try the past year paper and after that have discussion based on their answers. It is interesting seing the students tried to answer the questions by trying to run the code in their computer. It is good initiatives from the students.

I was observed this week and I managed to integrate the recommendations given to me prior. They are satisfied with my examination revision class.

I am marking students second assignments this week.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 18

**Date:** 15/05/2023 - 21/05/2023

This week is a revision week for the students. There are no formal classes conducted this week. But students do asked me in regards to some topics that they don't understand as preparation for the examination. I helped the students accordingly.

Using this chance of not having a formal class to attend United National Network (UNN) symposium 2023. It was an interesting experience where I was able to get new knowledge and networked with the industry.

Attended the PB town hall as well. Managed to get up to date with the current status of PB since I have been away for in-service in TVET Academy.

## Teaching Practice Week 19

**Date:** 22/05/2023 - 28/05/2023

This week is the examination week for network programming module. I had to actively went to the venue just in case the students have any questions about the examination paper. Then this week as well, I am marking the examination paper for this network programming module. Based on the students' performance, it looks like the students managed to captured the important concepts of network programming. It gave me a good feedback on where I could improve further in the future.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 20

**Date:** 29/05/2023 - 04/06/2023

Had to process students who were absent with valid reason from last week examination. Managed to find slot for the students to sit for the alternate examination paper on Thursday afternoon. During the alternate examination paper, there was an issue where I have to communicate with SICT management to help rectify the issue. I did not have to be physically there and managed to rectify the issue accordingly through Whatsapp communication.

During this week as well, helped students that failed the first attempt examination to revise for their resit examination which will be held next week.

<br>

## Teaching Practice Week 21

**Date:** 05/06/2023 - 10/06/2023

This week is the resit examination week for network programming module. A few students failed the first attempt examination, where they need to sit for this resit examination. Again, I had to actively went to the venue just in case the students have any questions about the resit examination paper. Then after the resit examination, proceed to mark the papers. All resit students passed their resit examinations for network programming.
